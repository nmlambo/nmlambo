### Hi I'm Ndumiso Mlambo and I love coffee. 👋🏼

I believe that user experience and accessibility advocates need strong allies in web developers, devs who believe that making things well and according to standards is a high priority because people are at the very center of everything we build.

- 🔭 Writing clean, readable code
- 🌱 I’m currently on a quest to make lightning fast web-apps with top grade UI
- 👯 I am open to collaborating!
- 🤝 I’m looking forward to make an amazing connection with you on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ndumiso-mlambo-a7a93423/" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a>
