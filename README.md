### Hi 👋🏼 I'm Ndumiso Mlambo a Product Builder and Software Developer. I love Coffee. 

I believe that user experience and accessibility advocates need strong allies in web developers, devs who believe that making things well and according to standards is a high priority because people are at the very center of everything we build.

## I'm focused on:

- 🔭 Writing clean, readable code
- 🌱 I’m currently on a quest to make lightning fast web-apps with top grade UI
- 👯 I'm open to collaborating!
- 🤝 I’m looking forward to make an amazing connection with you on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ndumiso-mlambo-a7a93423/" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a>
